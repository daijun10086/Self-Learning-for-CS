**A) Throwing Exception**

For a specific case just in ArraySet, see the code below, this code is the *contains* method for ArraySet.

    public boolean contains(T x) {
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if(items[i].equals(x)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

and it will incur a problem, if you use the code like below:

    s.contains(null);

you will get a *NullPointerException*. That is caused by when run the code **items[i].equals(null)**. If the value at items[i] is null, then we are calling null.equals(x) -> NullPointerException.

Exception cause normal flow of contronl stop. In fact, we can throw our own Exception, in Python we can use the *raise* keyword. In Java, Exceptions are objects and we throw exceptions using the following format:

    throw new ExceptionObject(parameter1, ...)

**B) Iteration**

Sometimes, we use a method called "enhanced for loop", the syntax just like below:

    for(String ss : s) {
    }

However, it is easy to find that the ArraySet we build just now can not be used in this way. The reason is ArraySet is not **Iterable**, if we want it support iteration, what we should do? 

The answer is we should make an iterator inside the ArraySet then we can use iteration in such syntax:

    Iterator<T> seer = s.iterator();

Obviously, the *iterator()* method in the ArraySet return an iterator, and the iterator must support two kinds of methods: **hasNext()** and **next()**. In order to make it useful, we have these code below:

    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new ArraySetIterator();
    }
    
    public class ArraySetIterator implements Iterator<T> {
        public boolean hasNext() {

        }

        public T next() {

        }
    }

for this case the code can be specify as:

   public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new ArraySetIterator();
    }
    
    public class ArraySetIterator implements Iterator<T> {
        private int wizPos;
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return wizPos < size;
        }

        public T next() {
            T returnItem = items[wizPos];
            wizPos += 1;
            return returnItem;
        }
    } 

Even though, we added these code make our ArraySet can be iterated, however, it does not support enchaned for loop, since we must tell java that it is iterable. It seems obviusly for you to know that ArraySet is iterable because we just added these code to support iteration, but for java, we should declare the inheritance relationship. What we should do?

We just add implments interface in the code:

    public class ArraySet<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    }

It is used to tell java that our ArraySet is **iterable** because it was implements *Iterable<T>*, which is a token of iterable.


**c) Static Vs. Non-Static**

This is an important topic I want to learn deeply, since during the coding, sometimes I met the problem and get the error meassage like:
*"'DMSList.this' cannot be referenced from a static context"*. 

Thus, I will search online and summarize here.

Most basically speaking, non-static methods are not belong to the class itself, but the instances which instanlize the class.
