# Self-Learning-for-CS
This repository is used to record all the things I get from the studies of CS by myself.
I am a student who is studying for his master degree, and my major is Optical Engineering. However, I found that I was getting more and more interests for Computer Science and Mathematics, so I choose to study more and more knowledge about Computer Science and Math, and now I am prone to research about AI. My goal of this progress of self studying is Mastering basci CS contents and also Math, like Data Structure and Algorithm, basic components of computer, Operating System, Compiler, Internet Network, Machine Lerning, Deep Learning, and so many basic Math, like Caculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics....

It is not easy to reach the terminal of this progress, but If I don't even try, I will never know and these knowledge is such charming! So I decide to create this repository to record my learning by GitHub, it is easy for me or everyone who is interested for these knowledge.

And for now, I am mainly focus on the [CS61B from UCB](https://sp18.datastructur.es/) and [CS224N from Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule), these two courses are mainly focus on Data Structure, Algorithm and NLP.
