## Interface

Some bullet points about interface:
- variable can exist in interface but only public static final;
- classes can extend more than one interface;
- methods are public unless stated othervise;
- interface cannot be instantiated.

## Abstract class
abstract class can be regarded as hybird of a normal class and an interface. Abstract class are like interface in that it can't be instantiated. All methods in an abstract class are like normal methods in classes, unless they have **abstract** keywords in front of them. If that is the case then they are treated like normal methods in interfaces and do not need to have a body and can instead have an implementation in whatever class extends them.  **A very important difference between interface and Abstract class is that a class can only extend one Abstract class but can implement more than one interface.**

More about Abstract class and Abstract method:

An Abstract class is a class that is declared **abstract** - it may or may not include **abstract methods**. Abstract class can't be instantiated but it can be subclassed. 
An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:

    abstract void moveTo(double x, double y);

if a class contains abstract methods, then the class must be an abstract class. More details can be found in the[document](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html).

And when an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually implement the abstract methods from the parent class, if it doesn't implement them, then you should declare the subclass as abstract class as well.

## Package
Package is a kind of namespace, which is a region that can be used to orginize code. To use a class from a different package use the following syntax:

    package_name.classname.subclassname a = new package_name.classname.subclassname();

in order to be more efficient, we can import the class following the syntax blow:

    import package_name.classname.subclassname;

You can in place of the subclassname by * if you want to import everything from the class(even thhough it seems like a bad coding style).


# CS224N-Lecture7-Machine Translation, Attention, Subword Models
A) RNN's advantages and disadvantages:
 - They can process input sequence of any length
 - The model size does not increase for longer input sequence, since all the weight matrices are shared every time step
 - Computation for step t can(in theory) use the information from many time steps back
 - The same weight are applied to every timestep of the input, so there is symmetry in how input are processed. (For the last point, I was little confused)

However, they also have some disadvantages:
 - Computation is slow - because it it sequential, it cannot be paralized, which incur to Attention and Transformer.
 - In practise, it is very difficult to access the information from many steps back due to the vanishing and exploding gradients.
