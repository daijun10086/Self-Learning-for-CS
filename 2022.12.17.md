## A) Something about Java
When I was doing the problem on LeetCode, in a problem, I need use the operator **&**, basically speaking, during the study of Java of cs61b, I almost do not use bit operation, so I am always be confused about bit operator like **Bitwise OR(|), Bitwise AND(&), Bitwise XOR(^), Bitwise Complement(~)**.

Thus, I decide to learn more about Bitwise operators mentioned above.

### Bitwise OR(|):
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘|’. It returns bit by bit OR of input values, i.e., if either of the bits is 1, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 

Example:
> a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
> 
> b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)
>
> Bitwise OR operation of 5 and 7:
>
> 0 1 0 1
>
> 0 1 1 1
>
> 0 1 1 1 = 7 (In Decimal)

### Bitwise AND(&):
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘&.’ It returns bit by bit AND of input values, i.e., if both bits are 1, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 

Example:
> a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
>
> b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)
>
> Bitwise AND operation of 5 and 7:
>
> 0 1 0 1
>
> 0 1 1 1
>
> 0 1 0 1 = 5 (In Decimal)

### Bitwise XOR(^):
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘^.’ It returns bit by bit XOR of input values, i.e., if corresponding bits are different, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 

Example:
> a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
>
> b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)
>
> Bitwise XOR operation of 5 and 7:
>
> 0 1 0 1
>
> 0 1 1 1
>
> 0 0 1 0 = 2 (In Decimal)

### Bitwise Complement(~):
This operator is a unary operator, denoted by ‘~.’ It returns the one’s complement representation of the input value, i.e., with all bits inverted, which means it makes every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0. 

Example:
> a = 5 = 0101
>
> Bitwise complement operation of a:
>
> 0 1 0 1
>
> 1 0 1 0 = 10 (In Decimal)


And I also find something worth noting is the operator **&** has two kinds of functions, it can be used as a**Relational operator** just like &&, but it has some subtle difference from &&. The relational operator && has short cut, which is that if the former is false then it will not actually implement the latter staement. However, for &, it does not have any short-cut, which means that we should finish the whole statements.

The essence of the different are:

- **&& operator:** It only evaluates the next condition, if the condition before it is true. If anyone condition is false, it does not evaluate the statement any further.
- **& operator:** It evaluates all conditions even if they are false. Thus, any change in the data values due to the conditions will only be reflected in this case.
