Question: Define a *Queue* class that implement *Push()* and *Poll()* methods of a *Queue* ADT using only stack class.

Answer: Stack and Queue have something different, stack is last-in first-out, but queue is first-in first-out, so if we want to implement a Queue by using Stack, we can use two stacks to reverse order. We use one stack to store the elements and use another stack to store the element pop from the before stack, two reverse order equals the order we want.

    public class Queue<E> {
        private Stack<E> stack = new Stack<E>();

        public void push(E element) {
            stack.push(element);
        }

        public E pop() {
            Stack<E> temp = new Stack<E>();
            while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
                temp.push(stack.pop());
            } 
            E toPop = temp.pop();
            while(!temp.isEmpty()) {
                stack.push(temp.pop());
            }
            return toPop;
        }
    }

    And the above method is using two stacks to implement the queue, but we can use only one stack and recursion to do that, which itself is called call-stack.

        public class Queue<E> {
            private Stack<E> stack = new Stack<E>();

            public void push(E element) {
                stack.push(element);
            }

            public E pop() {
                return pop(stack.pop());
            }

            public E pop(E previous) {
                if(stack.isEmpty()) {
                    return previous;
                }
                E current = stack.pop();
                E toReturn = pop(current);
                push(previous);
                return toReturn;
            }
        }
