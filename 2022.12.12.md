## A) Package

Package is a namespace that organizes the classes and interfaces. In general, when creating packages we should follow the following conventions: package names starts with the website, backwards.

For example, if Josh Hug were trying to distribute his Animal package, which contains various different types of animal classes, he would name his package as following:

    ug.josh.animal; // note: his website is josh.ug

**using package**: when we want to access some classes from the same package, we can just use its simple name;

    Dog d = new Dog(...);

But when we want to access some classes from outside of the package, we should use the its entire canonical name.

    ug.josh.animal.Dog d = new ug.josh.animal.Dog(...);

But we can import the package to avoid using such long name:

    import ug.josh.animal.Dog;
    ...
    Dog d = new Dog(...);

## B) Creating a Package

Creating a package following two steps:

**1) Put the package name at the top of every file in the package**

    package ug.josh.animal;
    ...
    public class Dog {
        private String name;
        private int size;
    }

**2) Store the file in a folder that has appropriate folder name. The folder should have a name that matches your package.**

i.e. *ug.josh.animal* package is in ug/josh/animal folder.

## C) Default packages
Any Java class without an explicit package name at top of the files is automatically consider to be part of the default package. However, when writing real programs, you should avoid leaving your files in the default package (unless it’s a very small example program). This is because class in default package can not be imported and it is very possible to create a class with the same name with another class in the default package.

    DogLauncher.launch(); // doesn't work
    default.DogLaucher.launch(); //doesn't exist

**Therefore, in real world Java programming we should declare explict package at the top of every files.**

## D) Access control
**Private** Only code in the given class can be access private members. It is truly private from everything else, as subclasses, packages, and other external classes cannot access private members.

**Package private** This is the default access given to Java members if there is no explicit modifier written. **Package private entails the classes belong to the same package can access, but not subclasses**, *TL;DR: only classes that live in the same package can access*

**Protected** Protected members are protected from the "outside" world, so classes within the same package and subclass can access these members but the rest of the world (e.g. classes external to the package or non-subclasses) cannot! *TL;DR: subtypes might need it, but subtype clients will not*

**Public** This keyword means that open up the access to everyone!

## E) Access Control Subtleties
Default Package Code that does not have a package declaration is automatically part of the default package. If these classes have members that don’t have access modifiers (i.e. are package-private), then because everything is part of the same (unnamed) default package, these members are still accessible between these “default”-package classes.

**Access is based only on Static type** It is important to note that for interface, the default access for its methods are actually public, not package-private.

## F) Efficient Programming
Efficiency comes in two flavors:

1.) Progrmmming cost
 - How long does it take to develop your programs?
 - How easy is it to read, modify, and maintain your code?
  
2.) Execution cost
 - How much time does your program take to execute?
 - How much memory does your program require?

### Encapsulation
We will first define a few terms:

- **Module:** A set of methods that work together as a whole to perform some task or a set of related taskes.
- **Encapsulated:** A module is said to be encapsulated if its implementation is completely hidden, and it can be accessed only through a documented interface.
  
### API's
An API(appliation programming interface) of an ADT is the list of constructors and methods and a short description.

API consists of syntactic and semantic specification.

- Complier verifies that syntax met.
- Tests help verify that semantics are correct.

### ADT's
ADT's (Abstract Data Structures) are high-level types that are defined by their behaviors, not their implementation.

Some ADT's are actually special cases of other ADT's. For example, Stacks and Queues are just lists that have even more specific behavior.
